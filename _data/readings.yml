For example, the role of concepts such as native, climate, diversity and even culture, which come from biology and then appear in discourses that attempt to naturalize racism, sexism and other human behaviors, goes beyond symbolic/linguistic realms to operate on material and procedural registers. Humans learned culture from nature. If domestication + cultivation + plasticity + gene expression = culture, other species are not only "cultured" but were necessary for the creation of human culture.'

In addition to descriptions and diagrams, it also criticizes scientific and economic developmentalism, and includes philosophical and speculative considerations about the socio-political consequences of these machines. In the end he comes to the conclusion that such a machine would not be so advantageous for the environment or for the arts, and that the earth, the sun and the stars form the true perpetual motion machine; even in the great inventions that use electricity and steam the real work is still being done by the planet. Human being''s obsession with work and development is an absurd competition with the planet, and peace and harmony are only possible through the recognition of this cosmic entanglement.'

Specifically, the functional connection between mechanics and electricity and their role in biological activity. In the process, Reich fuzzies other boundaries by proposing that a contractile vegetative nervous system, an uniform network of plasma, common to all living things, phylogenetically predates the cerebellum and is responsible for certain affects  like anxiety, rage, fright, pleasure in multi- and unicelular organisms. Everything contracts/expands at different levels: neurons, fluids, vegetative nervous system, organs, organisms, psyche, society. This is "the animal in man" and "the devil in the flesh".'

Includes an analysis of how the existence of an underlying dialectic of sex molds the history of culture. Shows how modern science has been determined and corrupted by this sex duality. Culture is the sum and dynamics between the idealistic and scientific modes of thought, and both sides are attempts to transcend the limitations of reality. This division between the aesthetic/subjective/intuitive/id and technological/objective/logical/ego recreates the sexual and psychological divisions, and contributes to the creation of its superstructure, the economic system.
