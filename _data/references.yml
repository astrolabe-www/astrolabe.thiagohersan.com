  image: 'media/images/references/stonehenge.jpg'
  text: 'Structure formed by stone circles, built between 3000 and 2000 BC in England. Despite much speculation about their true functionality, the placement of the stones correspond precisely to celestial events. In addition to signaling specific dates of celestial alignments (solstices and equinoxes), there is evidence that the structure could also have been used to predict eclipses.'

Outside the Islamic world, this measuring device had its moment in European history: it was essential in the dissemination and teaching of Islamic geometry during the Renaissance, and later, during the age of empires, it was instrumental in maritime "discovery" expeditions.'

  text: 'Proposed concept as an alternative / counterpoint to "interaction". Interaction requires pre-established subjects who then participate in actions with each other. Intra-action understands agency not as an inherent property of a subject, but as a dynamism of forces in which all bodies are constantly changing, influencing, and working inseparably.'

  text: 'It''s impossible to depend on an objectivity where devices (technology, media, instrument used to measure something) or the person using a device is not considered part of the process that allows for results and measurements. The boundaries of any object of study materializes in <a href="#Intra-action">social interactions</a> and therefore are constantly shifting and being redefined. These boundaries are drawn by mapping practices; "objects" of study do not exist before that.'

Aligned with eclipses and other celestial events, the city would mirror the harmony and reason of nature, but after a few generations the city found itself populated by "monsters". Latour''s monsters and Haraway''s <a href="#Cyborg+Manifesto">cyborgs</a> are also the result of mixing science, politics, nature and culture.'

It proposes to destroy gender, dismantle the "family", prohibit the use of nature as a guarantor of unequitable political positions, and to denaturalize the disciplines of science, technology, and rationalism, rejecting the idea that they are inherently masculine or patriarchal.'

As a result of the mixture of the biological and technological, the cyborg is a figure whose history is hybrid, multiple and transgressive by nature.

Within these modern societies, a hybrid is something that combines aspects that would traditionally be considered separately in their respective natural and social domains. For example, in a scientific context what is called a natural phenomenon is actually an association that would not have been possible without the laboratory, the research program, and the specific way of describing it.'

They are mythic mechanical representations of the eroticism, desire, love, ecstasy, isolation and death materialized in early industrial societies. They are the negation of procreation and human genealogy, but, at the same time act as totems for the kinship of human beings with the mechanical, instead of with the animal or the vegetal.'
